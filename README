About refbase
-------------
  refbase is a web-based solution for managing scientific literature,
  references and citations.
  
  Currently, the following features have been implemented for:
  EVERYONE
    - search the database using different search forms
    - search within results
    - browse found records and sort results by any database field
    - view results in different views (list view, citations, details,
      print view)
    - display results in different citation styles & output formats
    - export selected records to XML (Atom, MODS, OAI_DC, ODF) and (via
      the GPLed Bibutils programs) to ADS, BibTeX, EndNote, ISI, RIS and
      Word XML
    - display rich text (i.e., italics, super/sub-script, greek letters)
    - extract citations from a text & build an appropriate reference list
    - track additions via RSS and generate custom RSS feeds from searches
    - web services (SRU & OpenSearch) that allow clients to access a
      refbase database using a standard query syntax and retrieve results
      in structured XML format
    - dissemination of bibliographic data via standard methods (COinS &
      unAPI) allowing clients to automatically discover and extract data
      from refbase
    - search a refbase online database from the command line and retrieve
      results in various export & citation formats
  LOGGED IN USERS
    - user-specific fields which are stored individually for each user
    - import of records from common bibliographic formats and online
      databases via the web interface or the command line
    - automatic email announcements for newly added records
    - save and recall search queries
    - adding records to user-specific groups
    - add/edit/delete records as well as file upload & download links
  ADMINISTRATOR
    - user management interface provided to the database admin
    - set access permissions on a per-user basis
