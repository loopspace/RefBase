  These files mimic the Monobook skin from MediaWiki:
    <http://www.mediawiki.org/>
  This is the default skin for the Wikipedia:
    <http://wikipedia.org/>

  You may also be interested in the refbase extension for MediaWiki, included in the
    'contrib/mediawiki' directory from refbase.

  An installation of refbase that uses this skin is the Northwestern University
  Center for Atom-Probe Tomography:
