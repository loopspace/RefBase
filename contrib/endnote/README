About
-----
  This is an alternative to refbase's web-based import of Endnote data.  It
  allows  Endnote users to export a text file which can be imported into the
  refbase MySQL database.

Use
---
  Part I: Endnote
  - Copy refbase.ens into your Endnote styles directory.
    On win32 systems, this is typically:
      C:\Program Files\Endnote\Styles
    On Mac systems, this is typically:
      Macintosh HD\Applications\EndNote #\Styles
    (where # corresponds to a version #)
  - Open the Endnote file you wish to import into refbase.
  - Choose the refbase Output Style
  - Export to 'endnote.txt'
  Part II: PHP [*]
  - Executing 'php endnote2mysql.php' will produce 'import.txt'
    ('php' must be in your path or you should prefix it with the path to php)
  Part III: Check it!
  - As this is a preliminary script that has undergone little testing, it is
    suggested that you look at 'import.txt' in spreadsheet software.
  - New versions of Endnote dump UTF-8 data.  You should be able to use this as
    is if you have a UTF-8 database.  If you don't have a UTF-8 database, you
    should convert the file to the character encoding you do use (using iconv,
    recode, or <http://www.motobit.com/util/charset-codepage-conversion.asp>).
  Part IV: MySQL [*]
  - From within your MySQL command line interpreter (mysql -u root literature -p):
      LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "import.txt" INTO TABLE refs; 

[*]If you are comfortable that the script works and are on a system with a POSIX
   shell (nearly all *nix, including OS X; Windows through Cygwin or similar),
   you may use Andreas Czerniak's en-importer.sh to automate Parts II-IV.
