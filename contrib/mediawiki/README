About
-----
  This is an extension to MediaWiki:
    <http://www.mediawiki.org/>
  It allows you to cite references by enclosing the serial in tags such as:
    <refbase>17</refbase>
  The output will use citation templates, as are used on Wikipedia:
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_templates>
  To use, edit the 'refbase.php' file to reflect your database settings and
  place in the 'extensions' directory of your MediaWiki installation.  Add:
    require_once( "extensions/refbase.php" );
  to your 'LocalSettings.php' file.
  
  Currently, only journal articles may be cited.  In the future, this extension
  is likely to be modified.  'refbase' should be able to generate WP citation
  templates as an export format & this extension should make use of that
  functionality directly.

  You may also be interested in the MonoBook skin, included in the
  'contrib/skins/mediawiki-monobook' directory from refbase.
  
  An installation of MediaWiki that uses this extension is the Northwestern
  University Center for Atom-Probe Tomography:
