We are aware of the following problems, bugs and/or limitations:

- The advanced search form employs lots of dynamic drop-down menus to ease user
  entry of data. This works well for small databases (<10,000 records) but may
  cause significant speed problems for larger databases!

- There's no support for transactions. This means that multiple users will be
  able to edit the same record at the same time. This will usually cause the
  record to be overwritten by the last submitter, but it could cause surprising
  results. Please remember to reload record data if you kept a record's "edit"
  form open for a long period of time.

- The 'allow_edit_call_number' permission setting isn't honoured yet.

- The process of internationalization and localization has not been completed
  yet.

- Working simultaneously in different browser windows or tabs may cause some
  unexpected results (due to referrer-related issues). You can avoid problems if
  you reload the current browser window/tab before doing anything else in that
  window/tab.
